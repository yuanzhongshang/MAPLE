Title: MAPLE (a novel Mendelian randomization method with self-Adaptive
        determination of sample structure and multiple pleiotropic
        effects)
Version: 1.0
Date: 2024-05-06
Author: Liye Zhang
Maintainer: Zhongshang Yuan <yuanzhongshang@sdu.edu.cn>
Description: MAPLE utilizes a set of correlated SNPs, self-adaptively accounts for the sample structure and the uncertainty that these correlated SNPs may exhibit multiple pleiotropic effects, as well as explicitly models both uncorrelated and correlated horizontal pleiotropy.
